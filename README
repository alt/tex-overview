# TeX-overview #

This document gives an overview about the developments that followed TeX:
its children (new engines that provide more features) and its friends
(formats based on TeX or newer engines, programs that help you when working with TeX etc.)

Compile the tex-overview.tex with LuaLaTeX to get the pdf-file.
You may need an up-to-date TeXlive distribution to do so. The pdf contains
tooltips, so make sure your pdf viewer can display them –
or you will miss most of the information.
